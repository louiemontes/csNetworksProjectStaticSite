Team Info: 
Our team is composed of Austin Kelley, Brandon Kindrick and Luis Montes. We are all currently undergrads at NAU studying Computer Science. For our project, we decided to research the topic we all shared an interest in; board games. We came to this decision, because we all shared the common interest of board games and because we realized there was a lot of potential research topics.
